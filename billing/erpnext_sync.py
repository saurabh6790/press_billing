"""ERPNext Sales Invoice sync — async, one-way, non-blocking (issue #17).

After a billable invoice is Paid, a background job pushes a Sales Invoice to
ERPNext (the statutory accounting SOR). Cloud Billing stays the SOR for the
customer-facing balance, so this sync is **strictly outbound** and **failure
isolated**: an ERPNext outage never blocks or rolls back the customer invoice —
it stays Paid, the failure is recorded, and the sync is retried with
exponential backoff (3 attempts) before ops is alerted.

Corrections (refund credit notes, #15) flow *down* the same outbound channel;
nothing is ever read back from ERPNext into billing.
