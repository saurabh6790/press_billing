"""Post-payment corrections — refunds (issue #15).

Two destinations, two mechanics:

  - **Full dispute -> source.** Refund the captured amount through the gateway
    (`adapter.refund`, symmetric across Stripe/Razorpay). The invoice **stays
    Paid** with a linked Refund — there is no "refunded" state, which preserves
    GST immutability; the statutory credit note is issued in ERPNext (#17).
  - **Partial overcharge -> wallet.** Add the difference to the customer's
    wallet as a credit ledger entry, applied on the next invoice. No gateway
    round-trip — it is a credit, not a chargeback.

Pre-payment corrections (Draft/Open) are NOT refunds: cancel + reissue, so an
issued line item is never mutated (see billing.reissue_invoice).
