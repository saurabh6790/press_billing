"""Reconciliation — the charged-but-never-webhooked safety net (issue #21).

The single most important hardening job: a webhook can be lost, so a charge that
succeeded at the gateway might never settle. This daily scan queries the gateway
for attempts stuck in an ambiguous state and resolves them to a terminal state
by gateway truth — **read-only**, so it can never double-charge.

Terminal-state model (the resolved HITL decision — see issue #21):

  ambiguous = {initiated, authorised}     terminal = {captured, failed, refunded}
  grace 30 min (let the webhook arrive) · alert after 24 h
  gateway success  -> settle via charges._settle_invoice (idempotent), captured
  gateway failure  -> failed (dunning retries; invoice stays Open)
  no gateway record -> failed (safe; never dangling)
  still pending     -> leave; alert ops past the threshold
  provenance: resolved_by = reconciliation (vs webhook)
