"""Charge an open invoice and settle it on the webhook (issue #10).

The money loop: an `Open` invoice with an amount due gets a `Payment Attempt`
(idempotency_key = the attempt's name), is charged through the adapter, and is
marked `Paid` **only** when the gateway webhook confirms it — never on the
synchronous charge response. Each retry is a new attempt; concurrent charges of
one invoice produce at most one in-flight attempt, so only one reaches
`captured`.
