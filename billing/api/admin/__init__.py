"""Admin dashboard endpoints (issue #19).

Cost-Explorer-style aggregates + drill-down, plus the operational panels. Every
endpoint requires the Billing Admin role — a customer (or the Agent API key)
gets a 403. None of these are team-scoped: an admin sees across all teams.

Split into domain modules (revenue / teams / catalog) over shared helpers; this
package re-exports the public API so every `billing.api.admin.*` path holds.
