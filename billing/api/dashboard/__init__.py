"""Customer dashboard endpoints (issues #26, #18).

Every endpoint is auto-scoped to the caller's team via require_team_access — a
Billing User only ever sees their own team, and passing another team's name is
rejected (never silently widened). Admin-only data lives on the admin dashboard
(#19) behind require_billing_admin.

Split into domain modules (account / invoices / methods) with shared helpers;
this package re-exports the public API so every `billing.api.dashboard.*` path
(whitelisted endpoints + the after_migrate hook) stays stable.
