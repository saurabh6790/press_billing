"""Subscription intent + the two-axis state model (issue #04).

A Central Subscription is the customer's *intent/contract*, not billing truth —
the authoritative runtime record is born at the cluster and reported by the
Agent (#03). State lives on two orthogonal axes, never one enum:

  - operational (running / stopped / terminated) — owned by the Agent
  - account standing (current / past_due / suspended) — owned by Central, here

Central never stores the operational axis: a resource can be `running` and
`past_due` at once (normal grace), so collapsing them would lose information.
Every transition writes an append-only Subscription Change.
