"""Comprehensive demo dataset for the billing portal (#demo).

    bench --site billing.local execute billing.demo.demo_scenarios.seed_all

Wipes ALL billing data, then builds a realistic multi-region catalog and
ten teams so every dashboard criterion can be demonstrated:

* 3 clusters — India (Mumbai), Europe (Frankfurt), Middle East (Dubai).
* 5 plan sizes (1→16 vCPU), each priced per cluster x currency (INR/EUR/USD),
  so a team paying in one currency can subscribe to any region.
* 4 trust tiers (t0 trial → t3 enterprise). Higher-tier teams carry ~10 months
  of paid invoices; lower tiers a month or two.
* Mixed currencies, including INR-paying teams running in EU / Middle East.
* A grandfathering example: a long-standing team billed at its locked launch
  rate while the catalog price has since risen (price-lock discrepancy).
* Per-team states: active, overdue/dunning, suspended, prepaid credits, refund,
  and a free-trial cost report.

The catalog shape + record builders live in demo._factory; this module is the
orchestration. The Agent-side mirror lives in press_billing_agent.demo.seed.
