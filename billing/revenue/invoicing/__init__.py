"""Postpaid, in-arrears invoice generation (issue #09).

Two phases, decoupled to avoid the 1st-of-month bottleneck:

  Phase 1 (28th, heavy/off-peak): per active subscription, reconcile sync if
    stale, compute day-weighted line items from the Central price-lock segments
    (event-log time windows x the locked rate, with the max(1, end-start)
    floor), and create a `Draft`.

  Phase 2 (1st, light/parallel): one job per draft applies credits, claims the
    `Draft -> Open` transition atomically (no invoice processed twice), and
    leaves collection to the charge step (#10).

The price-lock ledger already encodes both the time windows (started_at/ended_at
per segment) and the locked rate, so billing reads only Central — no live Agent
call in the common (push-primary) case.

Split into modules (lines / generate / lifecycle); this package re-exports the
public API so callers and the `billing.revenue.invoicing.*` enqueue paths hold.
