"""Retry / dunning + staged suspension (issue #14).

Failed-payment handling, end to end and time-staged off the invoice due date:

  Day 1 / 3 / 7   retry the charge (each a new Payment Attempt), notify with the
                  failure reason.
  Day 7 (exhausted)   invoice -> Overdue, standing -> past_due. KEEP RUNNING
                      (grace) — being late is not yet being cut off.
  Day 14 (continued)  suspend directive on the entitlement-token channel (cap 0
                      + suspend) -> standing suspended -> the Agent stops the
                      resource (data preserved).
  Day 44 (~30d suspended)   terminate directive -> the Agent terminates.

Only a deliberate directive ever stops a resource. Central being unreachable
does not — the Agent keeps running on a stale token (see entitlement.enforcement
_state on the Agent).
