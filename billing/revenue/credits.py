"""Credit ledger — the customer's prepaid wallet (issue #06).

Every credit movement is an append-only Credit Ledger Entry. The balance is the
running sum, never a scalar on Team. Bookings serialise on a per-team Credit
Wallet anchor row via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`: a concurrent booking blocks on
that single primary-key row until the prior transaction commits, then reads the
now-current latest balance — closing the v1 concurrent double-spend race.

The lock is taken on the wallet anchor (a stable PK lookup) rather than on
"the latest ledger row": locking a moving `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1` target while
others insert into the same index gap deadlocks under InnoDB next-key locking.
The anchor row carries no balance — the balance is still purely the ledger sum.
