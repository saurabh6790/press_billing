"""Post-model-sync: merge legacy rate child rows into one `Catalog Rate` DocType.

Pairs with `snapshot_legacy_rate_children` (pre-model-sync). The two child tables
(`Plan Rate` on `Plan`, `Add-on Rate` on `Add-on`) are replaced by a single
standalone `Catalog Rate` DocType (ERPNext `Item Price` style) that links its
parent via a Dynamic Link: `priced_doctype` (Plan | Add-on) + `priced_for`.

For each snapshotted legacy row we INSERT a `Catalog Rate` document
(`priced_doctype` from the source table, `priced_for` = old `parent`, plus
`cluster`/`currency`/`rate`), named `{priced_for}-{cluster}-{currency}`. Rows
can't be renamed in place because they move into a different table. Once a legacy
table is drained we drop its DocType + table.

Self-guarding + idempotent:
  - if `Catalog Rate` doesn't exist yet (conversion not shipped) but legacy data
    is waiting, raise so the patch is NOT marked executed and re-runs once the
    DocType lands (the pre-sync snapshot is preserved meanwhile);
  - rows whose target identity already exists are skipped;
  - the scratch table is dropped only after its rows are migrated.
