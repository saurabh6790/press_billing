"""Settlement sources + credits-only wallet gating (issue #11).

Every team needs at least one settlement source — card/mandate autopay or
prepaid credits (or both). When both exist the bill is drawn credits-first,
then card (the waterfall in billing.open_and_collect).

A **credits-only** team (no autopay) is unsecured in a postpaid system, so the
wallet gates provisioning: its effective spend cap is `min(tier cap, wallet
balance)`. The running forecast compares projected month-end spend to the
balance and, at ~80%, prompts a top-up; the next token refresh shrinks the cap
*before* an overspend. Running resources are never stopped for this — only the
residual shortfall at settlement flows into dunning.
