"""Notification suite — Cloud Billing is the sole sender (issue #20).

v1 sent duplicate emails from both Press and the gateway. v2 routes every
customer-facing billing notification through this one module: it records a
Notification Log per team, honours the team's preferences, and is the only thing
that sends. Gateways never email the customer.

Each call also drops an Info comment on the referenced doc (Desk audit trail);
email dispatch is via frappe.sendmail in production (stubbed here — the
Notification Log is the record of intent).
